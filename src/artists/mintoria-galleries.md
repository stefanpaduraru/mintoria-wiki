# Galleries

The Mintoria platform currently has two galleries (Selected and Open World), each with its own smart contract (MTRSL, MTROW).

## Mintoria Open World

The Open World gallery allows all generative artists to publish their work on the platform with minimum curation. If you are an artist that have just begun your journey with generative art, or simply don't want to wait for the extended curation process and you'd like to publish your work right away, choose this gallery. The curation performed on projects published here is to check the validity of the project: deterministic, dimensionless etc.
Artists that publish on Open World and get recognition from the community through votes, will be invited to publish later projects on the Selected gallery.

## Mintoria Selected

Through Selected, Mintoria will publish projects that fit our generative art vision.
Our curation process selects the projects that are innovative, visually appealing and drive the generative community to progress.
Our curation board is comprised of generative artists and other creative people from all facts of life.
