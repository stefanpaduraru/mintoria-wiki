# Collectors

Collector, welcome to Mintoria, the generative art community!

## Metamask Login

Collectors need to connect their wallets through Metamask in order to access their account, and mint tokens.

Click the connect button to launch a Metamask signature request. <br />

First connect your mainnet ETH account, then accept the signature request.<br />

Accepting the signature request generates a web3 token valid for 24 hours and automatically logs you into the system.<br />

## Browsing Projects

You can view the most recent or the upcoming projects for each gallery on the homepage.
Alternatively, you can browse all the projects in each gallery through the projects menu.

## Minting

Start minting tokens from your favourite projects by navigating to a project details page and click on the Mint button.
<br />A metamask transaction confirmation popup will appear, asking you to review and submit the purchase. <br />

<br /><br />

Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the chain.<br />

Once the transaction is confirmed, you can already view your token in your account, but the artwork image will not have rendered yet. You can still enjoy the live token by going to the token details page.

<br />
The rendering starts once the transaction is confirmed, and can take from several seconds to several minutes, depending on the complexity of the artworks and the load on the platform.

## Your Tokens

You can access your tokens at any time by navigating to your profile page, and select the tokens tab.
